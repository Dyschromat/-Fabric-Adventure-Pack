# CHANGELOG

## ! Unreleased !

+ We hope all crashes are gone now, if so - the serverpack is close (sorry we just don't want to release something that crashes every 2 hours)
+ structures do now spawn more often
+ all uniques are now unidentified when they drop - that way you can sell the statroll to other players.
+ mcdarmours can now be upgraded with upgrade cores
+ salvage station overhaul - you can now get more materials out of it and also lootcrates
+ new origin "Stalker", hunt your enemies down with invisibility and strong poisons
+ added affixes to rare-, epic-, legendary- creatures to make them more visible
+ changed mob affix names
+ added new mob affix "soul" -> burns mana on hit
+ added new uniques (1)
+ added 4 new Runewords (Anomaly, Chaos, Rift, Madness)


## [4.0.9] 5.01.2020 - End Mechanix
+ Inmis, the backpack mod got a rewrite -> MAKE SURE TO EMPTY YOUR BACKPACKS INTO CHESTS BEFORE YOU UPDATE! BACKPACK CONTENT WILL BE WIPED!
+ You can brew the experience of your XP Book into XP Bottles (100 experiences is taken for each bottles) 85-130% of the amount is effectively on the bottle,
   you brew it into mundane potions
+ added a mailbox system (craft a transfer chest to access the global trade inventory)
+ better console output after crashes
+ added /trigger mercy command to singleplayer. Simply kills you if stuck somewhere until environment dmg gets fixed
